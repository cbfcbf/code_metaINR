\title{Meta-learning Implicit Neural Representation for Sparse Time Series Functional Data Analysis}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\subsection{Functional Data}

% Traditional multivariate statistics 把一个有限维空间中的向量作为研究对象，来分析它的统计性质，如均值向量、协方差矩阵等。在维度较小的时候，这并没有什么不妥。然而如果把分析对象所在空间的维度提高到无穷维，比如L2空间时，传统方法将会面临一些挑战。在函数空间，人们的关注点并不会局限于向量在某个维度上的取值，人们还会关注连续性、导数等更多性质。同时，随着空间增长到无穷维，原先多元统计中的很多指标也会丧失意义，如概率密度函数等。正是由于无穷维和有穷维空间的统计性质和人们关注点的不同，functional data analysis（FDA） 这个方向引起了研究者的广泛关注。
\textbf{Multivariate data versus functional data} 
Traditional multivariate statistics take finite-dimensional vectors as the objects of study to analyze their statistical properties, such as mean vectors and covariance matrices. 
This approach is appropriate and easy to compute when the dimension is relatively small. 
However, if the dimension of the space in which the objects are analyzed is increased to infinite, for example, in $L^2$ space, traditional methods face certain challenges. 
In such functional spaces, the focus is not only on the values of vectors in a particular dimension but also on properties such as continuity, smoothness and derivatives. 
At the same time, as the space grows to infinite dimensions, many useful tools in multivariate statistics, such as probability density functions, will lose their meaning. 
It is the differences in statistical properties and people's focus between infinite-dimensional and finite-dimensional spaces, that have led to widespread attention to functional data analysis (FDA) among researchers.

% Time series是一个很典型的需要在无穷维函数空间中处理的研究对象。这是因为现实中收集的时间序列数据往往具有连续性，同时，在某些情况下，人们会关注它的导数、时间对齐（registration）等话题。有很多之前的研究基于多元统计学对时间序列进行分析。比如···。从函数逼近的观点来看，这些基于多元统计的研究确实能够很好的反映一些时间序列的性质，但是这在很多情况下是比较难以推广的，比如本文中所研究的sparse time series data。
\textbf{Time series as a representative example of functional data}
Time series is a typical object that needs to be addressed in an infinite-dimensional function space. 
This is because time series data collected in reality often exhibit continuity, and, in certain situations, people may focus on topics such as derivatives and time alignment (registration).
Many previous studies have relied on multivariate statistics in the analysis of time series, such as [mention some specific examples]...
From the perspective of function approximation, these multivariate-statistics-based studies can indeed reflect certain properties of time series. 
However, in many cases, this approach is challenging to generalize, as is the case with sparse time series data studied in this paper.

% 当人们对time series的观测频率不高并且不规律的时候，就会形成sparse time series data。这种类型的数据在医学领域中尤其常见，因为人们只有在医院才会采集数据，而往往看病的次数是因人而异的，看病频率的也是不规律的。如果要用多元统计学分析这种类型的“杂乱”数据，人们往往会束手无策。在functional data analysis中，人们可以通过local polynomial regression的方法先估计出函数形数据的原始形式，然后在这个基础上估计均值，协方差算子等统计量（详见appendix）。local polynomial regression可以表示如下：
\textbf{Sparse times series data analysis}
When the observation frequency of time series is low and irregular, sparse time series data is formed. 
We can represent the sparse dataset of $n$ samples as 
$$D=\{(t_{ij},y_{ij})_{j=1}^{J_i}\}_{i=1}^n,$$ 
where
$y_{ij}=x_i(t_{ij}) , i=1, \cdots, n, j=1, \cdots, J_i$ and $J_i$ is the total observations of the $i$-th sample.
This type of data is particularly common in the medical field, as the frequency of medical visits varies from person to person, with irregular patterns.
When it comes to analyzing such "messy" data using multivariate statistics, people often find themselves at a loss.
However, in functional data analysis, one can employ the method of local polynomial regression to estimate the mean function and covariance operator of functional data.
Specifically, given our sparse observation of dataset $D$,
we can define the loss function to estimate mean function $\mu(t)$
$$
L_t^\mu(\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^{J_i}\left[y_{ij}-\sum_{r=0}^R \beta_r\left(t-t_{ij}\right)^r\right]^2 K\left(\frac{t-t_{ij}}{h}\right),
$$
where $K(\cdot)$ is the kernel function and $h$ is the bandwidth which shoud be carefully chosen based on data.
By minimizing this function, we can get
$\beta_t=(\beta_0(t), \cdots, \beta_R(t))=arg\,min L_t^\mu(\beta)$. The estimator of mean function cam be defined as $\hat{\mu}(t)=\beta_0(t)$.
Similarly, to estimate the covariance kernel $c(t,s)$, we define the loss function 
$$
L^c_{t,s}(\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{1\leq j, l, \leq J_i} K_{t,s}(\frac{t-t_{ij}}{h}, \frac{s-t_{il}}{h}) \left[ g(t_{ij},t_{il})-f\left(\beta,(t,s),(t_{ij},t_{il})\right) \right]^2
$$
where
$$
g(t_{ij},t_{il})=(y_{ij}-\hat{\mu}(t_{ij}))(y_{il}-\hat{\mu}(t_{il}))
$$
$$
f\left(\beta,(t,s),(t_{ij},t_{il})\right)=\beta_0 + \beta_{11}(t-t_{ij})+\beta_{12}(s-t_{il})
$$
By minimization of $L_{t,s}^c(\beta)$, we obtain $(\beta_0(t),\beta_{11}(t),\beta_{12}(t))=arg\,min L_{t,s}^c(\beta)$. Then the estimator of the covariance kernel is defined as $\hat{c}(t,s)=\beta_0(t)$.
Based on the estimation of mean and covariance,  we can use the method of Principal Analysis by Conditional Expectation (PACE) to reconstruct each sample and compute their scores (see details in the appendix).

% 下文中我会将基于这种方法得到的估计值作为Baseline与本文提出的基于metalearning的方法相比较。

\subsection{Implicit Neural Representation}

% 传统上，函数形数据的表示会用标准的网格法，即给定有限个坐标和函数值的pairs(ti,yi)。这么做有一定的缺陷：原来在无穷维空间中的函数形数据被离散化到了有穷维空间，它不仅不利于求导等计算，而且会极大影响函数的在一个较小时间区间上的分辨率。随着深度学习的兴起，人们发现可以利用深度神经网络来表示函数。···

% Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully. \textbf{Important:} This year the checklist will be submitted separately from the main paper in OpenReview, please review it well ahead of the submission deadline: \url{https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist}.


% \subsection{Style}


% Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2023 must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to {\bf nine} pages long,
% including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
% references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
% reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.


% The margins in 2023 are the same as those in previous years.


% Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
% NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
% and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
% rejection.


% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}


% The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
% the website at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+neurips_2023.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
% various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.


% The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2023 is \verb+neurips_2023.sty+,
% rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
%   Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}


% The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
% creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
% submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
% \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.


% \paragraph{Preprint option}
% If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
% NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
% nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
% in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit, as long as you do not say which conference it was submitted to. Please \textbf{do
%   not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
% papers accepted to NeurIPS. 


% At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
% options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
% review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
% will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.


% The file \verb+neurips_2023.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
% paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
% the paper with your own.


% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
% Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.


% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}


% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
% 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
% type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
% preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
% Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
% indentation.


% The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
% between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
% bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
% below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
% top of the page.


% For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
% centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
% first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
% follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
% side.


% Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


% \section{Headings: first level}
% \label{headings}


% All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
% flush left, and bold.


% First-level headings should be in 12-point type.


% \subsection{Headings: second level}


% Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}


% Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


% \paragraph{Paragraphs}


% There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
% bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
% of space.


% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}


% These instructions apply to everyone.


% \subsection{Citations within the text}


% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
% author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
% format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
% used consistently.


% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
% use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}


% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
% following before loading the \verb+neurips_2023+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}


% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
% argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2023}
% \end{verbatim}


% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
% person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
% previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
% (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.


% \subsection{Footnotes}


% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


% \subsection{Figures}


% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}


% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.


% \subsection{Tables}


% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.


% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{Math}
% Note that display math in bare TeX commands will not create correct line numbers for submission. Please use LaTeX (or AMSTeX) commands for unnumbered display math. (You really shouldn't be using \$\$ anyway; see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to} and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40492/what-are-the-differences-between-align-equation-and-displaymath} for more information.)

% \subsection{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.


% \section{Preparing PDF files}


% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''


% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.


% \begin{itemize}


% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.


% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.


% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.


% \begin{ack}
% Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
% go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
% funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
% More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


% Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
% \end{ack}



% \section{Supplementary Material}

% Authors may wish to optionally include extra information (complete proofs, additional experiments and plots) in the appendix. All such materials should be part of the supplemental material (submitted separately) and should NOT be included in the main submission.


% \section*{References}


% References follow the acknowledgments in the camera-ready paper. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
% the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
% consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
% when listing the references.
% Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.
